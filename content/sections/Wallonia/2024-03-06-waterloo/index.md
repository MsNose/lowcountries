## Waterloo

If you know more about this place than what is mentioned in the ABBA song, then that is already impressive. Waterloo was a typical insignificant stopping village on a trading route where people could get a break and spend the night. So except for a church and a few guest houses there were just empty fields everywhere.
 
This has not changed a lot. Waterloo kept its silent sleepy small-town image, but on top of this, thanks to the Battle of Waterloo, it became a touristic hot spot. After all, the Lion's Mound is one of the national symbols of Belgium. When you think about it, the monument itself is not so special. It is an artificial hill with a Leo Belgicus on top - the symbol of the Low Countries. But the surrounding mystic fields and the sheer size and earthiness of the monument make the visitors feel like they are entering sacred territories. Regardless of this uniqueness, I still did not figure out why they have to charge you 30 euros to climb up the stairs for the panoramic view and go through the battle museum. Luckily, there were anyways 2 other museums about the Battle of Waterloo to visit. Or maybe not luckily, because Wallonia is not famous for its quality cultural services. And it was not different in Waterloo.
 
To put it in a nutshell: the battle of Waterloo was a muddy, dirty fight on a wide field, not ideal for soldiers dressed in the typical early 19th-century elegant uniforms. On one side, it was Napoleon with the French army, and on the other, the unified Bristish-Prussian forces, led by the Duke of Wellington and  Blücher. Spoiler alert: the latter won. So this is the official end of the Napoleonic wars, a radically definitive era of European history.
 
Therefore, it is no surprise that for the 200th anniversary of the battle, the Belgians wanted to mint coins with the Lion monument and the battlefield map. However, the French did not fancy this idea, so it had to be canceled after all. The already-minted materials were allowed to be sold only as commemorative coins.

To sum up, there is only one booming part in Waterloo: Le Pain Quotidien. It means 'daily bread', but the cafè itself could not be farther from the average. It is a typical hip, Americanized brunch place where you can get everything from vegan cringe desserts to sourbread in a 'stylish' setting. The chain was originally founded in Brussels and is clearly popular in the Francophone part. Not like they have a choice: Le Pain Quotidien is the only thing where you can go for a nice saturday lunch. There are not many options in Wallon towns. They are rather creepy ghost towns that you just want to leave ASAP (see the parking lot for the Delaize below). That is why it is fascinating that they managed to establish such a parallel world with Le Pain Quotidien. But I am still wondering how the Wallons with a 13% unemployment rate can afford 6 euro fancy breads. I guess they have a secret I do not know yet.
 
Fun fact: the battle of Waterloo was really bloody, with 50,000 men being killed or wounded. So the archeological findings in the fields must have been enormous, right? Well, no. There were no bodies left on the battlefield. Why would you just let these bodies rot there when you can use them as fertilizer? Yes, the bodies of the dead soldiers were ground down and taken back to England to use as fertilizer. What a great example of sustainability! The climate activist should make the Duke of Wellington their idol, not Greta Thunberg.
