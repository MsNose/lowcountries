If you wanna go on a beach holiday in Europe, there are a couple of options. But somehow it is the Mediterranean Sea that pops first into mind as an ideal vacation place. Why not the North Sea? Here are some clues:


| Aspect            | North Sea                                      | Mediterranean                                |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Geography         | Located between the coasts of Northern Europe | Located between Southern Europe, Africa, and the Middle East |
| Size              | Approx. 570,000 square kilometers             | Approx. 2.5 million square kilometers         |
| Water & Climate   | Cooler temperatures, temperate climate        | Warmer temperatures, Mediterranean climate    |
| Major Ports       | Rotterdam, Hamburg, Antwerp                   | Marseille, Barcelona, Genoa                  |
| Trade Routes      | Connects Northern Europe to the Atlantic      | Connects Europe, Africa, and the Middle East |
| Economic Activity | Major hub for oil, gas, and general cargo shipping | Important for tourism, shipping, and trade |
| Strategic Importance | Vital for European energy supply and trade | Historic trade routes connecting three continents |
| Popular Goods     | Oil, natural gas, machinery, vehicles         | Olive oil, wine, fruits, vegetables          |


Both Seas created a special history and culture. While the Mediterranean Golden Age with Ancient Greece, Rome, and later Genova and Venice with its trading were dominant powers in the beginning. The North Sea came to bloom later with the discoveries, Hanza League, Bruges, Antwerpen, Amsterdam, and thus the econimic heart of Europe moved northwards. This can still be seen today when you compare the monthly traffic on the two areas. Even though the Mediterranean is much bigger in size, it does not seem to have proportionatley more traffic. This was surprising to me, because one would guess the calm and warm nature of the Mediterranean creates an attrictive climate for trade. Or at least a more attractive climate than the North Sea. For people not familiar with this concept can be enlightened by Britannica:

>"The North Sea is one of the most dangerous seas in the world. It has wild storms and foggy winters. Because the sea is mostly shallow, the currents are strong and often pull in different directions."

So yes, there is not much swimming their. In fact, the beaches have 'swimming forbidden' signs everywhere. So the most satisfaction the holiday seekers can get is to just stand in the water, while cold, harsh waves are hitting them. Still, the Vlaamse Kust, the small part of Belgium bordering the North Sea is already full in May. Thus, literally the emptiest part of Vlaanderen gets so busy, that you cannot avoid traffic jams in the whole West-Vlaanderen province, and even the tram which connects the coastline is constantlt overpacked. Considering the fact that this is the longest tram line in the world connecting Knokke in the north, bordering the Netherlands and De Panne in the South, almost in France. This 67 km Kusttram takes around 3 hours, but I could hardly survive on it 15 minutes. I dont even want to imagine how it during summer, when it is extremely hot and even fuller. 

But the Sea is not the most shocking part. I can imagine that during the hot summer waves it just nice to lie next to refreshing water, even if you cannot swim. The shocking part is, that on the beachline there is no presence of nice prime real estate hotels and residences. The view is endless blockhouses, with all flavors from the classic Soviet blocks to the glassy 20-years-ago-modern and now rotting blocks. Ans the row is endless, the whole beach is built purely in this style. It is hard for me to imagine that this gettho architecture creates a popular tourist destination. Because it is not just the Belgians who come here. Actually, they were the minority. The biggest group were French and German people. I would get it if you live rigth across the border in France it is just a jump for you. France is going through such an insane decline that I would be not surprised if this is the most beautiful place the neighbouring French can get to. But that the Germand drive all the way from Salzburg? Are they sure that they cannot find any other slightly more enjoyable place closeby than the Vlaamse Kust? Europe must be truly miserable if this is an ideal weekend escape for people. 

There is only one town worth visiting. De Haan is the outlet of the Vlaamse Kust. No, there are no actual shops there. It is just a perfectly fake town, dominiated by new fairly tail style German Fachwerk houses, villas, and cute cobbled streets. It is exactly how outlets are; a fek minimalist but traditional village located at a poor or abandoned are where real-estate is cheap. No wonder this was the favorite spot for the young families and rich pensioners. 

There is something mysterious and wonderful about the North Sea that inspires me to have a walk along the coast. But I am sure it is not going to be at the Vlaamse Kust.
