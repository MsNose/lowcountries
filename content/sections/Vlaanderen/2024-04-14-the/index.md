The Northern, Dutch speaking part of Belgium is called Vlaanderen. The name comes from the County of Vlaanderen, the historical territory consisting of todays Oost and West - Vlaanderen, a bit of the neigbourig France, a bit of Henegouwen, Antwerpen provinces and  Zeeuwse Vlaanderen in the north. The county was however divided into two parts. The west of the Schelde was under the French king, called Kroon Vlaanderen, and the east, Rijks Vlaanderen, with the Land van Aalst and Zeeland were officially under the Holy Roman Emperor. Since most of the rich town were located in the French part, it was undeniably more significant. Moreover, there was another division. In the area of Lille (Frans-Vlaanderen) French was the dominant language, while in the rest of the county people spoke Dutch. This map gives a better overview of these territories.

Naturally, this culturally and economically diverse county did not exist without conflicts; but its significance is proved by the fact that existed from 862 to 1795. That's a pretty long time when teenagers today can't even pay full attention to a 20 second TikTok video.

The voting behaviour of these territories are still linked, preferring more the right side of politics, also in France and in the Netherlands. Further, the catholic conservative is still dominant in West-Vlaanderen and Zeeland, and the dividing line between Kroon and Rijks- Vlaanderen is also still visible. 

This Kroon and Rijks devision comes from the countries these parts were officially part of: Most of Vlaanderen belonged to the French Crown (Kroon-Vlaandren), while the land around Aalst and the landconnected part of Zeeland were officially under the Holy Roman Emperor. Although the Emperor did not bother them much, today Rijks-Vlaanderen shows the greatest discrepencies in voting. aOn one hand, it the eastern border the most cohesive Vlaams Belang block is present, which is the far-right Flemish nationalist party famous for wanting independance and scraping up immigration. Usually, Vlaams Bleang voters are not having the best life. We saw it in Aalst, which could be a relatively nice town, but due to the high share of foreigners and uncivilized behaviours that we witnessed the locals lost the connection to their home. As a result, almost all pubs on the main square had the Flemish nationalist flag hanging on their doors, a clear sign of not favoring the non-Flemish origin inhabitants. 

On the other hand, right next to these angry Vlaams Belang municipalities there is a belt of OpenVld. I am not an expert on Flemish poilitics, but in general, when it comes to liberal parties I cannot say what they have done. Usually they don't do much. So no wonder, that they have around quarter of the votes in the municipalities South of Gent. These are the elites living here, in the the fairy tail villages with the nature and the calm while still being one jump away from the big city, where they probably work but found it too miserable to actually live there. This demographic went so far, that they turned into luxus farmers. They are living in the middle of nowhere, owning a little field that they do not use for big-scale agricultural and business purposes, just maintain it because it is nice to have it. The next neighbours are a few 100 metres away, so you can breath in the silence, the fresh air, and the hugging of the sun. As if it could not have been more of an escape to the old, valueable days, a big group of scoutes cycled by the rocky field roads, their joyful laugh leaving a wave of excitement behind. 

This luxus farmer lifesyle takes a different form in the very richest municipalities. They keep goats and deers in their garden just for the fun of it, and have either a lake, river, or forest next to their villa, gems that are in general hard to spot in Vlaanderen. The only thing that might give a hint that Sint-Martens-Latem is the richest municipality is the unnecessarly high number of art studios and Teslas.

There were many outstanding towns that shaped the history of Europe, Gent and Kortrijk being the most important ones in Oost-Vlaanderen. They deserve another post.
