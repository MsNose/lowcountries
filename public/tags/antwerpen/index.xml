      <description>The biggest city of Vlaanderen. The second biggest harbour in Europe. The diamond capital of the world. I would have not realized any of these things, because Antwerp looks like an average boring German town.</description>

      <description>The centrum of Vlaanderen. The first real capital was established by Philip the Good during the Burgundian golden age. Thus the home of many politicians who were members of the Great Council.</description>

      <description>This is a 7000 inhabitant municipality in the Netherlands. It would just be an average boring small town, however, it has something that I have never experienced before.</description>

      <description>Lierke Plezierke - Fun little Lier. That is the nickname of the town. Indeed Lier is a really pleasant town, maybe that is why even Johanna from Castilia was motivated enough to ditch Spain and come here to the Low Countries for her wedding with Filip the Schone.</description>

      <description>The town has a 1 km long border with the Netherlands, but it feels like you are already on the other side. A modern business building is welcoming you at the station, which could be also in Tilburg or Eindhoven.</description>
